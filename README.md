# EPPR

Here you can find all the slideshows and notes for the course 'R for EPP research'. More information about the course are included in the wiki -- see on the left.

## Lecture 1
Lecture 1 took place on the 19 of November 2015, from 12:00 to 13:45 at Utrecht University.
The **slides** can be found in the folder "Lecture 1", under the name "Lecture1.html". The relevant
code can be found in the same folder under the name "index.Rmd".
NOTE: I had to remove parts of the twitter code as it contained personal information. Apart from that,
the rest of the code should work fine.

The **example code** can be in the same folder under the name "exampleScriptShare.R". The HTML result
is under the name "exampleScriptShare.html". Be aware that if you want to run the code, you will generate 2000 csv files.
If you want to generate a smaller number of samples (e.g., 20) change *1:2000* to the number of sample you want (e.g., *1:20*).
